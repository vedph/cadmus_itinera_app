    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Itinera project editing dashboard.</p>
    <p>
      You can use this dashboard to edit the Itinera database composed of
      letters, correspondents, poetic texts, manuscripts, and hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently the data you will find here is randomly generated by the
      software, to allow you using the editor. Editor parts are being developed.
      If when you edit a part you get bumped to the homepage, this just means
      that that part's editor is not yet ready.

    <h2>Sub-Models</h2>
    <p>
      In our data design, several models share some sub-models. For instance,
      whenever a structured person name occurs (as a correspondent in a letter,
      as an actor in the history of a manuscript, etc.), this can be of type
      <code>PersonName</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As data is modular, so is the editing system. In this case, we provide an
      editor for each sub-model, which can be included into a higher-order
      editor, thus composing its UI.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see the
      <a routerLink="/sub-demo">sub-models editors page</a> for a live
      demonstration.
