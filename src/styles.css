/* Offline material icons: used for developing.
   To remove, just comment out this import.
   The local font files are under assets/icons. If you want to totally
   remove local icons, just delete the whole folder besides removing
   this import. Their source is
   https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/iconfont
   (when downloading from there, open each file in GitHub and click Download,
   as right clicking on the file name and selecting Download link as won't
   work as expected, producing corrupt files).

/* @import "assets/icons/material-icons.css"; */
/* Note: as of 2020, https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web
   is out of date and no non-TTF fonts are found in the Material
   Design Icons repository.
   See https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/issues/1092.
   We thus comment the import because its icons are no more up to date.
